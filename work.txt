### 🟦 **Slides 02 & 03 – Personal Context**

**Title:** *Personal Research Context*

**Corrected and Polished Text:**

* My bachelor thesis topic was **“Filtration of Viscous Fluids in Porous-Elastic Media.”**
  This subject lies at the intersection of **fluid mechanics and solid mechanics**, making it both fascinating and challenging.

* It can be approached through **experimental, analytical, or numerical** methods.
  Today, thanks to advances in **Machine Learning**, we can revisit such complex physical problems from a data-driven perspective.

* I am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence** while working as an **AI Engineer**.
  My goal is to strengthen my **mathematical and theoretical background** so that in the future, I can apply AI techniques to **fluid and solid mechanics**.

* During my bachelor research, I faced many modeling challenges that required large-scale experiments and datasets.
  Now, new **Deep Learning** approaches allow us to extract insights and discover relationships that were once unreachable due to computational limits.

* I maintain a strong interest in **Darcy’s Law** and **hydraulic phenomena** in porous media.
  This law underpins processes such as **oil recovery** and **fluid filtration**, directly linking my earlier work with the **PhD thesis under analysis**.

* Although hydraulic fracturing is a well-studied area, much remains unexplored.
  I believe the integration of **AI with fluid mechanics** can lead to significant breakthroughs in engineering design and optimization.

**Design Tip:**
Use 2 slides: first for academic journey, second for connection to the thesis topic. Add one image of porous media or a schematic of filtration flow.

**Title:** *Summary of Official Review*

* **Overall Evaluation:** Well-written and structured thesis; high-quality research.
* **Strengths:**

  * Relevant methods and strong practical value.
  * Publications exceed PhD program requirements.
* **Critiques & Recommendations:**

  * Some figures (e.g., 2.1, 2.4) hard to read — font too small.
  * Undefined terms: “pad share,” “pad volume.”
  * Acronyms like t-SNE and NaNs need definition and context.

Would you like me to now generate:
1️⃣ A **ready-to-copy version** (Markdown or `.pptx` outline) with layout placeholders, or
2️⃣ Include also **slides about the defense discussion** once you share the YouTube transcript?

That way I can finalize your PowerPoint completely (≈ 15 slides total).
